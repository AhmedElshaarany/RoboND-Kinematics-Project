## Project: Kinematics Pick & Place

**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Set up your ROS Workspace.
2. Download or clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) into the ***src*** directory of your ROS Workspace.  
3. Experiment with the forward_kinematics environment and get familiar with the robot.
4. Launch in [demo mode](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/7b2fd2d7-e181-401e-977a-6158c77bf816/modules/8855de3f-2897-46c3-a805-628b5ecf045b/lessons/91d017b1-4493-4522-ad52-04a74a01094c/concepts/ae64bb91-e8c4-44c9-adbe-798e8f688193).
5. Perform Kinematic Analysis for the robot following the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view).
6. Fill in the `IK_server.py` with your Inverse Kinematics code.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

The forward_kinematics demo was used to derive the DH parameters. Below is a screenshot of running the demo.

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Below is the Modified DH parameters table for the Kuka arm.

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1
1->2 | - pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 |  - pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.5 | q4
4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

The individual transformation matrices about each joint and the generalized homogeneous transform between base\_link and gripper\_link using the gripper pose are shown in the IK_server.py script in lines (49-68). 


#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

The math for deriving the theta angles for the each joint is shown in the IK_server.py script in lines (121-146). Below is a drawing that depicts how theta2 and theta3 were calculated.
